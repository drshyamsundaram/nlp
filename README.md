# Quick definition to NLP
Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. The goal is a computer capable of "understanding" the contents of documents, including the contextual nuances of the language within them. The technology can then accurately extract information and insights contained in the documents as well as categorize and organize the documents themselves.
Challenges in natural language processing frequently involve speech recognition, natural language understanding, and natural language generation.

# NLP related resources
What is NLP ? Natural Language Processing(NLP), a field of AI, aims to understand the semantics and connotations of natural human languages. It focuses on extracting meaningful information from text and train data models based on the acquired insights. The primary NLP functions include text mining, text classification, text analysis, sentiment analysis, word sequencing, speech recognition & generation, machine translation, and dialog systems, to name a few.

The fundamental aim of NLP libraries is to simplify text preprocessing. A good NLP library should be able to correctly convert free text sentences into structured features (for example, cost per hour) that can easily be fed into ML or DL pipelines. Also, an NLP library should have a simple-to-learn API, and it must be able to implement the latest and greatest algorithms and models efficiently.

# Why is NLP hard? 
NLP is hard because natural languages evolved without a standard rule/logic. They were developed in response to the evolution of the human brain: in its ability to understand signs, voice, and memory. With NLP, we are now trying to “discover rules” for something (language) that evolved without rules.

# Understanding Textual Data 
[Reference](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/getting-started-with-natural-language-processing-using-python/)

Elements of Text Let us now understand various elements of textual data and see how we can extract these using the NLTK library. Now we shall discuss the following elements of the text:

## Hierarchy of Text

Tokens
Vocabulary
Punctuation
Part of speech
Root of a word
Base of a word
Stop words

# Tokens
A meaningful unit of text is a token. Words are usually considered tokens in NLP. The process of breaking a text based on the token is called tokenization.

# Vocabulary
The vocabulary of a text is the set of all unique tokens used in it

# Punctuation
Punctuation refers to symbols used to separate sentences and their elements and to clarify meaning.

# Part of Speech
Part of speech(POS) refers to the category to which a word is assigned based on its function. You may recall that the English language has 8 parts of speech – noun, verb, adjective, adverb, pronoun, determiner, preposition, conjunction, and interjection.
Different POS taggers are available that classify words into POS. A popular one is the Penn treebank, which has the following parts of speech.

# Root of a word – Stemming
Stemming is a technique used to find the root form of a word. In the root form, a word is devoid of any affixes (suffixes and prefixes)

# Base of a word – Lemmatization
Lemmatization removes inflection and reduces the word to its base form

# Stop words
Stop words are typically the most commonly occurring words in text like ‘the’, ‘and’, ‘is’, etc. 
NLTK provides a pre-defined set of stopwords for English, as shown

# Frequency Distribution
Frequency distribution helps understand which words are commonly used and which are not. These can help refine stop words in a given text.

# Conditional Frequency Distribution
Conditional Frequency Distributions can help in identifying differences in the usage of words in different texts. 
For example, commonly used words in books/articles on the “romance” genre could be different from words used in books/articles of the “news” genre. 
An example with nltk library to get the conditional frequency distribution of words.
Here we use the Brown corpus. [Reference](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch02.html)

# N-grams
N-gram is a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text or speech. NLTK provides methods to extract n-grams from text

# Working with Regex Expression 
How it works A-Z Searches in the input string for characters that exist between A and Z a-z Searches in the input string for characters that exist between a and z ? Number of occurrences of the character preceding the? can be 0 or 1 . Denotes any character either alphabet or number or special characters
The number of occurrences of the character preceding the + can be at least 1 or more w Denotes a set of alphanumeric characters(both upper and lower case) and ‘_’ s Denotes a set of all space-related characters

# What is Named Entity Recognition (NER) 
Named-entity recognition is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition)

Refers to locating and identifying key entities (e.g., company names, product names, location names) within text. NER is an important component of many language applications and is usually the first step in information extraction projects.

# What is Named Entity Recognition (NER) 
The Corpus of Linguistic Acceptability (CoLA) in its full form consists of 10657 sentences from 23 linguistics publications, expertly annotated for acceptability (grammaticality) by their original authors. The public version provided here contains 9594 sentences belonging to training and development sets, and excludes 1063 sentences belonging to a held out test set.

# Transformers ([Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model))
A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of self-attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and in computer vision (CV).

Like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to handle sequential input data, such as natural language, for tasks such as translation and text summarization. However, unlike RNNs, transformers do not necessarily process the data in order. Rather, the attention mechanism provides context for any position in the input sequence. For example, if the input data is a natural language sentence, the transformer does not need to process the beginning of the sentence before the end. Rather, it identifies the context that confers meaning to each word in the sentence. This feature allows for more parallelization than RNNs and therefore reduces training times.

Since their debut in 2017, transformers are increasingly the model of choice for NLP problems, replacing RNN models such as long short-term memory (LSTM). The additional training parallelization allows training on larger datasets than was once possible. This led to the development of pretrained systems such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which were trained with large language datasets, such as the Wikipedia Corpus and Common Crawl, and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.

# BERT [Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model))
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) is a transformer-based machine learning technique for natural language processing (NLP) pre-training developed by Google. BERT was created and published in 2018 by Jacob Devlin and his colleagues from Google. In 2019, Google announced that it had begun leveraging BERT in its search engine, and by late 2020 it was using BERT in almost every English-language query. A 2020 literature survey concluded that "in a little over a year, BERT has become a ubiquitous baseline in NLP experiments", counting over 150 research publications analyzing and improving the model.

The original English-language BERT has two models: (1) the BERTBASE: 12 Encoders with 12 bidirectional self-attention heads, and (2) the BERTLARGE: 24 Encoders with 16 bidirectional self-attention heads. Both models are pre-trained from unlabeled data extracted from the BooksCorpus with 800M words and English Wikipedia with 2,500M words.
